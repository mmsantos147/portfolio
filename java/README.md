## Java Pokedex
- This is a java back-end application using spring framework
- The purpose of this project is to train my Java skills and turn them into something tangible
- This API has a CRUD with a Pokémon theme, where I can add, search for, remove Pokémon from the database
- For now, the front-end is not implemented, but I plan to develop one in the near future.
